# Regression and Classification Problem for Power Consumption Prediction
The objective is to develop a data-driven predictive model for the power consumption of an industrial refrigeration system using the Data_Rack01 dataset.
## Machine Learning Algorithms
### Regression 
* Linear Regression
* Ridge Regression
### Classification
Convert the target variable in the dataset into a binary variable using >= mean thresholding.

Target varible becomes 1 if its value is greater than or equal to the mean thresholding.

Target varible becomes 0 if its value is less than the mean thresholding.
* Logistic Regression
* Linear Support Vector Machine (LinearSVC)
